### Notes ###

> Finding someone today is probably more complicated and stressful than it was for previous generations-but your are also more likely to end up with someone you are really excited about.

Most of the tension comes because we try to find the best thing in life. Best sofa, best deals, best couples. Maximizer try to find the best deal or the soulmate while sufficers (person okay with sufficient quality) find someone they could build a life with. In this we forget **people are not product**.  

In dating profile, we say we need this and that kind of parameter for your partner. In doing that, girls could miss out some short guys who could really bond with them _[advocating for short guys]_. Having specific set of parameter, 6ft guy, while you don't even know that what you want can lead to unsuccessful relationships. _I thought this was really good point because we don't know what we like unless we experience. Preference may not be what you really want._  

This connects with the idea, you must click on the first date which is not necessarily true. _think about some friend which you didn't like at all then after one semester class together turn out to be your best friend. Same thing can happen in your search of soulmate._  


> Don't think of online dating as dating-think of it as an online introduction service.   

He advice to use online dating as making contact. you should ask for date on couple of message when you comfortable other end person is good fit for you. Do not prolong conversations and not ask her out. If she is still talking to you, then she is interested. An there is whole, **waiting game**. also there is game we play 'don not reply', 'say busy' or 'say truth'. while we want other person to say the truth we end of saying we are busy.   
Also, just don't initiate conversation with dumb 'Hi'. Think about how many 'hi' a girl would get and how little it says about you. Better to have one personalized **copypasta** to introduce yourself for online matches. _I think this is a neat advice. I hadn't thought about this._

**Passionate vs Compassionate Love**  
We tend to have passionate love while we are dating. Basically a honeymoon period then when it fades and leads to compassionate love, lots of people think their love for other person has dissipated. This, might, be wrong. You guys might have simply move to compassionate love. Since, passionate love is not possible over a time, compassionate love is how you spent your life with your partner.


### Some Problems in online dating ###
+ we treat other people based on the little fact they expose in the internet.
+ we seem to cast different online persona because consequences are to be different. 

> Treat potential partners like actual people, not bubbles on a screen.



### Interesting cultural tangent ###
**Japanese culture**  
Japan population is in decline. It is considered that most bachelor are herbivore man, _they don't actively court girls_  
Some reasons presented by author:   
+ economic decline : why marry and have more financial burden?
+ men's infantalization: mother treat their sons as kings making them dependent. most men find hard to complete simple task as cooking own food.
+ fear of rejection: cultural pride and shaming plays more role in this.
+ lack of contact with opposite sex: segregated schools, some until high schools. _come on Japan_   

There is less activity in online dating in Japan because it is considered as a weakness. For those of people interested, it is common to have **rice cooker** as your profile picture.  

**Hostess club**  
Places, restaurants in Japan where you will be treated well, as king, by opposite sex in non-sexual way. They will give their undivided attention and treat you. They will listen to your talking, et: for a time! _weird, I know_

+ men basically court girls in the street to the point of harassment. 
+ women saying 'no' is taken as invitation or in other words men don't get discourage by it. In some cases, women say 'no' in fear of appearing too eager. _yeah, this is weird and practiced in many culture_
